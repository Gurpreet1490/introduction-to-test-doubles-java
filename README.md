Plan:
- Bubble Tea Order Service
    - This will be the application for learners to USE to understand the concepts

Using the example application, they can work through the following activities:

Use (Predict, Run, Investigate):
- Provide learners with a list of questions/prompts to answer
- Identify the test doubles / guide on test doubles used

Modify:
- Get learners to add a unit test and provide the code/guide to to this

Make/Create:
- Get learners to add their own unit tests (unguided) so they can get started with the libraries/packages for that language
